Background Paper 1:
Title: Airborne LiDAR Sampling Strategies to Enhance Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation from Landsat Imagery
Abstract: Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation over large areas requires the integration of field plots, remotely sensed data, and modeling approaches. Airborne LiDAR provides high-accuracy structural measurements but at high cost, while Landsat imagery offers broad spatial coverage at low cost. We evaluated the effectiveness of systematic, random, and stratified sampling designs for LiDAR acquisitions to calibrate AGB models based on Landsat spectral metrics across a boreal forest landscape. Stratified sampling based on forest age and species composition strata yielded the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and bias in AGB estimates at the landscape scale. Our results indicate that carefully designed LiDAR sampling can reduce the number of LiDAR strips required by up to 40% while maintaining prediction accuracy, providing a cost-effective pathway for regional AGB mapping programs.

Title: Deep Learning for Tree Species Classification Using UAV-Acquired Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Fusion
Abstract: Accurate tree species classification at the individual-tree level is essential for biodiversity monitoring, carbon accounting, and forest management planning. We present a multi-sensor deep learning framework that fuses hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR point clouds acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on fused feature representations outperformed single-sensor baselines by 12 percentage points in overall accuracy across a temperate mixed forest. Transfer learning from pre-trained models reduced the data requirements substantially, enabling high-accuracy classification with fewer than 200 labeled training trees. Our approach demonstrates the potential of low-cost UAV surveys combined with deep learning to deliver high-resolution species maps at operationally relevant scales.

Title: Scalable Multi-Source Remote Sensing Fusion for Wall-to-Wall Forest Carbon Stock Mapping Across Biomes
Abstract: Accurate and spatially exhaustive mapping of forest carbon stocks remains a critical bottleneck for national greenhouse gas inventories and REDD+ monitoring frameworks. Recent advances in airborne LiDAR sampling design and UAV-based deep learning for species classification have individually demonstrated high accuracy at local to regional scales, yet their integration into a scalable, wall-to-wall carbon mapping pipeline applicable across diverse biomes has not been systematically explored. We propose a research direction that combines stratified LiDAR sampling strategies optimized for carbon-relevant forest strata, UAV hyperspectral-LiDAR species classification at intensively sampled calibration sites, and spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral time-series as spatially continuous predictors. A hierarchical Bayesian model would propagate uncertainty from individual-tree species assignments through stand-level allometric equations to landscape-scale carbon estimates. This framework would be evaluated across boreal, temperate, and tropical forest biomes using standardized benchmark plots, with the goal of providing a reproducible, uncertainty-quantified carbon monitoring workflow that national forest agencies can operationalize with publicly available satellite imagery.

Background Paper 1:
Title: Climate Change Amplifies the Risk of High-Severity Wildfire in Western North American Forests
Abstract: Observational records and fire behavior modeling indicate that anthropogenic climate change has substantially increased the probability of extreme fire weather conditions across western North America over the past four decades. Analyses of fire radiative power and burn severity indices reveal a consistent trend toward larger, more severe fires since the 1980s, correlating with increases in summer vapor pressure deficit and reductions in live fuel moisture content. Projections under multiple CMIP6 scenarios suggest that the area burned annually at high severity could double by mid-century under moderate warming trajectories. These findings underscore the urgent need for adaptive forest management strategies that reduce landscape-scale fuel loads and increase structural heterogeneity to moderate fire behavior.

Background Paper 2:
Title: Post-Fire Forest Regeneration Dynamics in Mixed-Conifer Forests: Effects of Burn Severity and Seed Source Distance
Abstract: Post-fire tree regeneration is highly sensitive to the spatial pattern of burn severity and the distance to surviving seed trees. We surveyed seedling densities across 124 transects installed in high-, moderate-, and low-severity patches in a mixed-conifer forest five years after a large wildfire in the Sierra Nevada. High-severity patches farther than 150 m from seed sources showed near-zero conifer regeneration, whereas low-severity patches regenerated reliably regardless of seed source distance. Climate conditions during the first three post-fire summers were the dominant predictor of seedling survival after emergence. Our results highlight a growing regeneration deficit in the interior of large high-severity burn patches that may prevent natural forest recovery under warming climates.

Predicted Research Direction:
Title: Predicting Post-Fire Reforestation Feasibility Under Climate Change to Guide Assisted Regeneration Prioritization
Abstract: Mounting evidence shows that large high-severity burn patches in western mixed-conifer forests are failing to regenerate naturally under warming climates due to seed-source distance limitations and increasingly adverse post-fire climate conditions. Simultaneously, climate projections indicate a continued expansion of extreme fire weather. This convergence creates an urgent need for spatially explicit, predictive frameworks that identify where natural regeneration will fail under future climate scenarios so that limited reforestation resources can be prioritized. We propose a research direction integrating post-fire regeneration process models calibrated on long-term seedling monitoring datasets with high-resolution burn severity mapping and downscaled climate projections. The framework would estimate regeneration feasibility at the patch level as a function of burn severity class, seed-source proximity, soil moisture, and projected summer temperature and precipitation for the 1–5 years post-fire. Outputs would be used to develop assisted regeneration decision rules that distinguish areas warranting active planting from those where natural recovery remains probable. Validation against independent post-fire monitoring datasets and sensitivity analyses across projected climate trajectories would quantify uncertainty in prioritization decisions, providing managers with actionable and defensible guidance for large-scale reforestation investment under a non-stationary fire regime.

Background Paper 1:
Title: Tree Diversity and Canopy Structure Drive Understory Plant Diversity in Temperate European Forests
Abstract: Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in forests are mediated by the vertical structure created by diverse tree assemblages. We analyzed understory plant species richness and composition across 180 forest stands in central Europe spanning a gradient from monocultures to highly diverse mixed stands. Tree species richness and canopy structural complexity, quantified as the coefficient of variation of LiDAR-derived canopy height, jointly explained 52% of the variance in understory plant diversity. The diversity-promoting effect of canopy complexity was most pronounced in stands experiencing moderate levels of light availability, suggesting a hump-shaped relationship between overstory canopy closure and understory richness. These findings have direct implications for close-to-nature silviculture prescriptions aimed at maximizing biodiversity co-benefits in managed forests.

Background Paper 2:
Title: Landscape Genetic Connectivity of European Beech Populations Along a Latitudinal Gradient
Abstract: Understanding how landscape features shape gene flow among tree populations is essential for predicting their adaptive capacity under climate change. We sampled European beech (Fagus sylvatica) from 42 populations spanning a 1,200 km latitudinal gradient and genotyped individuals at 12,000 SNP loci via reduced-representation sequencing. Isolation-by-resistance models incorporating forest cover, elevation, and road density explained genetic differentiation substantially better than isolation-by-distance models alone. We identified three genetically distinct regional clusters corresponding to refugial lineages, with limited contemporary gene flow across major agricultural and urban fragmentation barriers. Populations at the warm-rear edge showed the greatest differentiation and lowest genetic diversity, highlighting their vulnerability to future climate warming.

Predicted Research Direction:
Title: Integrating Structural Diversity and Landscape Genomics to Optimize Mixed-Species Planting Designs for Climate-Adaptive Forest Restoration
Abstract: Forest restoration programs increasingly recognize the need to simultaneously maximize biodiversity co-benefits and long-term adaptive capacity under climate change, yet silvicultural planting designs rarely integrate both canopy structural diversity objectives and genomic insights on adaptive potential. Building on evidence that canopy structural complexity drives understory plant diversity, and that landscape genetic structure constrains the adaptive variation available within regional beech populations, we propose a research direction that develops spatially explicit planting design optimization tools for mixed-species restoration. The framework would combine target canopy structural complexity metrics derived from desired biodiversity outcomes with provenance selection rules informed by landscape genomic data, matching genotypic diversity of planted stock to predicted future climate envelopes while avoiding the disruption of locally adapted gene complexes. Simulation models would evaluate trade-offs between short-term growth performance, structural complexity development over time, and long-term genomic diversity under alternative climate and disturbance scenarios. By bridging the gap between structural silviculture and conservation genomics, this research direction aims to provide operationally implementable guidance for restoration practitioners seeking to build resilient, diverse forests that deliver sustained ecosystem services across the coming century.
