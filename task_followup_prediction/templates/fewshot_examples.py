                "abstract": "We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions. The method is straightforward to implement and is based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments of the gradients. The method is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The method exhibits invariance to diagonal rescaling of the gradients by adapting to the geometry of the objective function. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. We demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods."

                "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the strong power of large text-to-image diffusion models for the impressive generative capability to create high-fidelity images. However, it is very tricky to generate desired images using only text prompt as it often involves complex prompt engineering. An alternative to text prompt is image prompt, as the saying goes:\"an image is worth a thousand words\". Although existing methods of direct fine-tuning from pretrained models are effective, they require large computing resources and are not compatible with other base models, text prompt, and structural controls. In this paper, we present IP-Adapter, an effective and lightweight adapter to achieve image prompt capability for the pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. The key design of our IP-Adapter is decoupled cross-attention mechanism that separates cross-attention layers for text features and image features. Despite the simplicity of our method, an IP-Adapter with only 22M parameters can achieve comparable or even better performance to a fully fine-tuned image prompt model. As we freeze the pretrained diffusion model, the proposed IP-Adapter can be generalized not only to other custom models fine-tuned from the same base model, but also to controllable generation using existing controllable tools. With the benefit of the decoupled cross-attention strategy, the image prompt can also work well with the text prompt to achieve multimodal image generation.

                "title": "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models",
                "abstract": "By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion."

                "abstract": "Analyzing and reconstructing visual stimuli from brain signals effectively advances the understanding of human visual system. However, the EEG signals are complex and contain significant noise. This leads to substantial limitations in existing works of visual stimuli reconstruction from EEG, such as difficulties in aligning EEG embeddings with the fine-grained semantic information and a heavy reliance on additional large self-collected dataset for training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called BrainVis. Firstly, we divide the EEG signals into various units and apply a self-supervised approach on them to obtain EEG time-domain features, in an attempt to ease the training difficulty. Additionally, we also propose to utilize the frequency-domain features to enhance the EEG representations. Then, we simultaneously align EEG time-frequency embeddings with the interpolation of the coarse and fine-grained semantics in the CLIP space, to highlight the primary visual components and reduce the cross-modal alignment difficulty. Finally, we adopt the cascaded diffusion models to reconstruct images. Using only 10\\% training data of the previous work, our proposed BrainVis outperforms state of the arts in both semantic fidelity reconstruction and generation quality. The code is available at https://github.com/RomGai/BrainVis."

A natural followup would extend the EEG visual decoding work by incorporating style information alongside semantic content, leveraging the adapter and diffusion model insights.\nTitle: BrainDecoder: Style-Based Visual Decoding of EEG Signals\nAbstract: Decoding neural representations of visual stimuli from electroencephalography (EEG) offers valuable insights into brain activity and cognition. Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the field of visual decoding of EEG, primarily focusing on reconstructing the semantic content of visual stimuli. In this paper, we present a novel visual decoding pipeline that, in addition to recovering the content, emphasizes the reconstruction of the style, such as color and texture, of images viewed by the subject. Unlike previous methods, this ``style-based'' approach learns in the CLIP spaces of image and text separately, facilitating a more nuanced extraction of information from EEG signals. We also use captions for text alignment simpler than previously employed, which we find work better. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method better preserves the style of visual stimuli and extracts more fine-grained semantic information from neural signals. Notably, it achieves significant improvements in quantitative results and sets a new state-of-the-art on the popular Brain2Image dataset."

                "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows parties to perform computations on data while keeping that data private. This capability has great potential for machine-learning applications: it facilitates training of machine-learning models on private data sets owned by different parties, evaluation of one party's private model using another party's private data, etc. Although a range of studies implement machine-learning models via secure MPC, such implementations are not yet mainstream. Adoption of secure MPC is hampered by the absence of flexible software frameworks that\"speak the language\"of machine-learning researchers and engineers. To foster adoption of secure MPC in machine learning, we present CrypTen: a software framework that exposes popular secure MPC primitives via abstractions that are common in modern machine-learning frameworks, such as tensor computations, automatic differentiation, and modular neural networks. This paper describes the design of CrypTen and measure its performance on state-of-the-art models for text classification, speech recognition, and image classification. Our benchmarks show that CrypTen's GPU support and high-performance communication between (an arbitrary number of) parties allows it to perform efficient private evaluation of modern machine-learning models under a semi-honest threat model. For example, two parties using CrypTen can securely predict phonemes in speech recordings using Wav2Letter faster than real-time. We hope that CrypTen will spur adoption of secure MPC in the machine-learning community."

While most secure deep learning techniques utilize MPC operations to achieve feasible privacy-preserving machine learning on downstream tasks, the overhead of the computation and communication still hampers their practical application. This work proposes a low-latency secret-sharing-based MPC design that reduces unnecessary communication rounds during the execution of MPC protocols. We also present a method for improving the computation of commonly used nonlinear functions in deep learning by integrating multivariate multiplication and coalescing different packets into one to maximize network utilization. Our experimental results indicate that our method is effective in a variety of settings, with a speedup in communication latency of $10\\sim20\\%$."

                "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities but face challenges such as hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes. Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to these issues by incorporating real-time data from external databases into LLM responses. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the models, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This survey paper provides an in-depth analysis of the evolution of RAG, focusing on three key paradigms: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG. It methodically examines the three fundamental components of RAG systems: the retriever, the generator, and the augmentation methods, underscoring the cutting-edge technologies within each componenet. Additionally, the paper introduces novel metrics and capabilities for evaluating RAG models, as well as the most recent evaluation framework. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions from three perspectives: future challenges,modality extension,and the development of the RAG technical stack and ecosystem."

                "abstract": "The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as\"What are the main themes in the dataset?\", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be indexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages: first to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a naive RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag."

        "response": "Reasoning: The RAG survey covers retrieval-augmented generation paradigms, while Graph RAG addresses global questions via knowledge graphs. A followup could simplify and speed up graph-based RAG while maintaining quality.\nTitle: LightRAG: Simple and Fast Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nAbstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses tailored to user needs. However, existing RAG systems have significant limitations, including reliance on flat data representations and inadequate contextual awareness, which can lead to fragmented answers that fail to capture complex inter-dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose LightRAG, which incorporates graph structures into text indexing and retrieval processes. This innovative framework employs a dual-level retrieval system that enhances comprehensive information retrieval from both low-level and high-level knowledge discovery. Additionally, the integration of graph structures with vector representations facilitates efficient retrieval of related entities and their relationships, significantly improving response times while maintaining contextual relevance. This capability is further enhanced by an incremental update algorithm that ensures the timely integration of new data, allowing the system to remain effective and responsive in rapidly changing data environments. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches. We have made our LightRAG open-source and available at the link: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG."
